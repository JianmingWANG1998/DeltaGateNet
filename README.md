# DeltaGateNet

> **Update (January 2026)**: Create a template for the DeltaGateNet project.

## Start using the template
In this project, we should introduce the background and datasets. Then, we explain our model architecture. Finally, we show our model results compared with other benchmarks.

## Background (Motivation & Datasets & Challenges )
